# Miscellaneous Python Modules
A collection of Python modules for things I've frequently needed

### Motivation
I try to limit my use of 3rd-party libraries wherever possible.
These modules are intended to be easily copyable (single-file) solutions to common problems where bare-bones simplicity and no dependencies is preferable to "feature rich" dependencies I have no control over.
